If you want to load the game , than follow these directions:
load hangman_list.py # It contains the list of words used for a random selection
     clashangman.py  # It contains class Player. Read the docu comment at the top of the program
     class_gamehang.py # It contains the game itself like a class Game
     gamehang.py       # It runs the game as an instance of class Game 


If playing first time the Hangman, the 'memory' file
          historydict
should be created.
An initial dictionary
history = {'Anonymous': (0,0)}
has to be added to a file, such that
 the pickling jar is created.
You need to add the lines bellow to the program containing the class Player
and run it once, such that the file historydict becomes a physical file
(it is created).
Afterwords, the lines could be ereased since the'memory' is set.
history = {'Anonymous': (0,0)}
f1 = open('historydict,p', 'wb')
pickle.dump(history, f1)
f1.close()
f1 = open('historydict,p', 'rb')
history = pickle.load(f1)
f1.close()
