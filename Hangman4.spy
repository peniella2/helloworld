If playing first time the Hangman, the 'memory' file
          historydict
should be created.
An initial dictionary
history = {'Anonymous': (0,0)}
has to be added to a file, such that
 the pickling jar is created.
You need to add the lines bellow to the program containing the class Player
and run it once, such that the file historydict becomes a physical file
(it is created).
Afterwords, the lines could be ereased since the'memory' is set.
history = {'Anonymous': (0,0)}
f1 = open('historydict,p', 'wb')
pickle.dump(history, f1)
f1.close()
f1 = open('historydict,p', 'rb')
history = pickle.load(f1)
f1.close()
